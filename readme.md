# 🚗 Used Car Dataset EDA  

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a used car dataset to uncover insights into factors affecting car prices, mileage, brand resale value, and other attributes.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis on a used car dataset.  
The goal is to understand key factors influencing car prices and prepare the data for potential predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Key Steps in EDA  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Convert data types  
   - Create derived features (e.g., car age)  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Price distribution  
   - Mileage distribution  
   - Fuel type, transmission, and ownership type counts  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Price vs Brand  
   - Price vs Mileage  
   - Price vs Transmission / Fuel type / Age  

4. **Correlation Analysis**  
   - Heatmaps for numeric features  
   - Identify strongest predictors of price  

5. **Outlier Detection**  
   - Cars with unrealistic prices/mileage  
   - Visual outlier detection with boxplots

## 📊 Visualizations  
The analysis includes:  
- Histograms & KDE plots for distributions  
- Countplots for categorical features  
- Scatterplots & boxplots for relationships  
- Correlation heatmaps  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🚀 Outcomes  
- Key factors influencing car resale price identified  
- Relationship between brand, mileage, age, and price explored  
- Insights useful for **pricing models** and **predictive analytics**
